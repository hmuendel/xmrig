# xmrig helm chart

This is a helm chart for deploying the [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) monero miner.
The idea was, to use a mining software to utilise spare resources in a k8s cluster to mine while idle.
Monero was choosen because of the resiliance against ASIC miners but for me the result was underwhelming.
